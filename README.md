# Stochastic-tanh
Stochastic mathods help reduce hardware resources required to generate complex mathematical functions like tan(h), tan(x), exp(x) etc. I have taken an existing algorithm which computes 
tanh(X) using Finite State machines and optimised it by adding specific constants in specified ranges of x. Mean squared error loss has been reduced up to 350% and hardware resources required has been reduced upto 25%.
